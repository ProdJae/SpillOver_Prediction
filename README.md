A SpillOver Warning System
Suffice it to say that there will always be things to distract a student but like in other aspects of life, 
having clear idea of impending positive or negative outcome keeps one honest to his goals. 
This is what an early-spillover warning system would offer a student. 
To get the students focused on their studies, it is pertinent to have this early warning, especially, 
to those who are tending towards overstaying their minimum study period. It is, 
indeed, difficult for this role to be done by a human due to large number of students and the cumbersomeness of the students’ data or records he has to go through in order to identify those students who are liable to spend extra period. 
Interestingly, machine learning, has proven efficient in realising predictive models from data.
